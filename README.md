## Summary

We are going to construct a clone of Stack Overflow. Our goal is to make clean readable code while ensuring everything works. The technologies we will be using are Sinatra, Jquery, AJax, ActiveRecord. We will also be using Trello for team communication. 

### Features

- Users can post questions.  Other users can answer them.
- Users can comment on both questions and answers.  Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
- The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
- Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
